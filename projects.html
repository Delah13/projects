            <h1>Projects</h1>
            <p>I have worked on various projects that have allowed me to apply my skills and learn new technologies.
                Here are some of the notable projects I have completed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hostel Hub:</strong> A comprehensive platform for hostel booking and management. This
                    project involved creating a user-friendly interface for students to find and book hostels, as well
                    as a management system for hostel administrators to manage bookings and accommodations efficiently.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> This very portfolio page is a demonstration of my skills in HTML, CSS,
                    and responsive web design. It showcases my ability to create clean, professional, and user-friendly
                    web pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Inventory Management System:</strong> Developed to streamline the process of managing
                    inventory for businesses. This system includes features such as stock tracking, order management,
                    and reporting tools to help businesses maintain optimal inventory levels and improve operational
                    efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each project has taught me valuable lessons in software development, project management, and teamwork. I
                am always eager to take on new challenges and expand my portfolio with innovative and impactful
                projects.</p>
